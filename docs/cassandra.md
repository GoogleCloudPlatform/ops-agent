# `cassandra_system`, `cassandra_debug` and `cassandra_gc` Logging Receivers

## Configuration

To configure a receiver for your cassandra system logs, specify the following fields:

| Field                 | Default                       | Description |
| ---                   | ---                           | ---         |
| `type`                | required                      | Must be `cassandra_system`. |
| `include_paths`       | `[/var/log/cassandra/system*.log]` | A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card (`*`) can be used in the paths; for example, `/var/log/apache*/*.log`.
| `exclude_paths`       | `[]`                          | A list of filesystem path patterns to exclude from the set matched by `include_paths`.

To configure a receiver for your cassandra debug logs, specify the following fields:

| Field                 | Default                      | Description |
| ---                   | ---                          | ---         |
| `type`                | required                     | Must be `cassandra_debug`. |
| `include_paths`       | `[/var/log/cassandra/debug*.log]` | The log files to read. |
| `exclude_paths`       | `[]`                         | Log files to exclude (if `include_paths` contains a glob or directory). |

To configure a receiver for your cassandra gc logs, specify the following fields:

| Field                 | Default                      | Description |
| ---                   | ---                          | ---         |
| `type`                | required                     | Must be `cassandra_gc`. |
| `include_paths`       | `[/var/log/cassandra/gc.log.*.current]` | The log files to read. |
| `exclude_paths`       | `[]`                         | Log files to exclude (if `include_paths` contains a glob or directory). |

Example Configuration:

```yaml
logging:
  receivers:
    cassandra_default_system:
      type: cassandra_system
    cassandra_default_debug:
      type: cassandra_debug
    cassandra_default_gc:
      type: cassandra_gc
  service:
    pipelines:
      apache:
        receivers:
          - cassandra_default_system
          - cassandra_default_debug
          - cassandra_default_gc
```
