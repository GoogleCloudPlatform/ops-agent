# `redis` Metrics Receiver

The redis receiver can retrieve stats from your redis server through the [INFO](https://redis.io/commands/info) command. 


## Configuration

Following the guide for [Configuring the Ops Agent](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/ops-agent/configuration#file-location), add the required elements for your redis configuration.

To configure a receiver for your redis metrics, specify the following fields:

| Field                 | Default                   | Description |
| ---                   | ---                       | ---         |
| `type`                | required                  | Must be `redis`. |
| `address`             | `localhost:6379`          | The url exposed by redis |
| `collection_interval` | `60s`                     | A [time.Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) value, such as `30s` or `5m`. |
| `password`            |                           | The password used to connect to the server. |

Example Configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  receivers:
    redis_metrics:
      type: redis
      address: localhost:6379
      collection_interval: 30s
      password: pwd
  service:
    pipelines:
      redis_pipeline:
        receivers:
          - redis_metrics
```

## Metrics

The Ops Agent collects the following metrics from your redis servers.

# `redis` Logging Receiver

## Configuration

To configure a receiver for your redis logs, specify the following fields:

| Field                 | Default                       | Description |
| ---                   | ---                           | ---         |
| `type`                | required                      | Must be `redis`. |
| `include_paths`       | `[/var/log/redis/redis-server.log, /var/log/redis_6379.log, /var/log/redis/redis.log, /var/log/redis/default.log, /var/log/redis/redis_6379.log]` | A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card (`*`) can be used in the paths; for example, `/var/log/redis/*.log`.
| `exclude_paths`       | `[]`                          | A list of filesystem path patterns to exclude from the set matched by `include_paths`.


Example Configuration:

```yaml

  receivers:
    redis_default:
      type: redis
  service:
    pipelines:
      redis:
        receivers:
        - redis_default
```
