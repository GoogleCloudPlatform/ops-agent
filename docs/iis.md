# `iis_access` Logging Receiver

## Configuration

To configure a receiver for your IIS system logs, specify the following fields:

| Field                 | Default                           | Description |
| ---                   | ---                               | ---         |
| `type`                | required                          | Must be `iis_access`. |
| `include_paths`       | `['C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex*']` | A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card (`*`) can be used in the paths; for example, `C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex*`. |
| `exclude_paths`       | `[]`                              | A list of filesystem path patterns to exclude from the set matched by `include_paths`.
| `wildcard_refresh_interval` | `60s` | The interval at which wildcard file paths in `include_paths` are refreshed. Specified as a time interval parsable by [time.ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). Must be a multiple of 1s.|

This receiver currently only supports the default W3C format.

Example Configuration:

```yaml
logging:
  receivers:
    iis_access:
      type: iis_access
  service:
    pipelines:
      iis:
        receivers:
          - iis_access
```
