## Metrics

The Ops Agent collects the following metrics from your flink instance.

Resource Attributes:

These resource attributes are Flinks system scope variables, which contains context information about metrics. These are required to uniquely identify incoming metrics as the same job can run multiple times concurrently. See https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/ops/metrics/#system-scope for more information.
