    # This test verifies that the prometheus receiver fails when the discovery method is anything
    # other than static_config.
    #
    # Note that the failure for this test is not happening due to the validation we added but rather
    # a YAML parsing error. It seems as though the service discovery inlined struct for service discovery
    # is not supported by the YAML parser. This is a known issue:
    #
    # See:
    # https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/issues/125
    # https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/issues/602
    #
    # Go get around this issue, the OTel collector unmarshals the prom config differently by ahving
    # the receiver do its own unmarshal into YAML. Supporting that in the Ops Agent is not trivial
    # and left for another time.
