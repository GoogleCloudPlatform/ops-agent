  The Internet Information Services (IIS) integration collects metrics from your
  IIS web servers. The metrics provide connection information and also data on
  transferred bytes.

  When using the Ops Agent on a Microsoft Windows VM, the agent automatically
  collects IIS metrics. No additional configuration is required.
