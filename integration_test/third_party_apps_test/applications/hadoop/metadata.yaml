  The Apache Hadoop integration collects name-node metrics related to storage,
  such as capacity utilization, file accesses, and blocks. The integration also
  collects Hadoop logs and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes
  fields for source, level, and message.

  To expose a JMX endpoint, you must set the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port`
  system property when starting the JVM. We also recommend setting the
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port` system property to the same port. To
  expose a JMX endpoint remotely, you must also set the `java.rmi.server.hostname`
  system property.

  By default, these properties are set in a Hadoop deployment's `hadoop-env.sh`
  file.

  To set system properties by using command-line arguments, prepend the property
  name with `-D` when starting the JVM. For example, to set
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` to port `8004`, specify the following when
  starting the JVM:

  <pre>
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8004
  </pre>

This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
