  The Apache Cassandra integration collects request, task, and storage metrics
  that highlight the load on an instance. Optionally, the integration can also
  collect general JVM metrics related to memory and garbage collection. The
  integration also collects system, debug, and garbage-collection logs. These logs
  are parsed into a JSON payload, which includes fields for the message, Java
  class, and line number.
configure_integration: |-
  To expose a JMX endpoint, you must set the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port`
  system property when starting the JVM. We also recommend setting the
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port` system property to the same port. To
  expose a JMX endpoint remotely, you must also set the `java.rmi.server.hostname`
  system property.

  By default, these properties are set in a Cassandra deployment's
  `cassandra-env.sh` file.

  To set system properties by using command-line arguments, prepend the property
  name with `-D` when starting the JVM. For example, to set
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` to port `7199`, specify the following when
  starting the JVM:

  <pre>
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=7199
  </pre>
