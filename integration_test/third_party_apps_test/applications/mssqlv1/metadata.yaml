  The v1 Microsoft SQL Server integration collects metrics from your SQL Server
  instances. The metrics provide transaction-rate information and also data on
  open connections.

  The v2 Microsoft SQL Server integration collects metrics from your SQL Server
  instances and databases. Page, batch, lock, and user connection count information
  is provided at the instance level. Transaction and transaction log information
  is provided at the database level.

  This integration doesn't support SQL Server named instances.
