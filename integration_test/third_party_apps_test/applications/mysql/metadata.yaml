description: |-
  The MySQL integration collects performance metrics related to
  InnoDB, the buffer pool, and various other operations. It also collects general,
  error, and slow-query logs and parses them into a JSON payload. Error logs are
  parsed for their error code and subsystem. Slow-query logs are parsed into
  key-value pairs that describe the performance of a query, including query time
  and rows examined.
configure_integration: |-
  The `mysql` receiver connects by default to a local MySQL
  server using a Unix socket and Unix authentication as the `root` user.
