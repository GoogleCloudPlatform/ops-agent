This will download the content at the given URLs and upload it to:

https://storage.googleapis.com/ops-agents-public-buckets-vendored-deps/mirrored-content/<URL without http:// or https://>

This script can only be run by Googlers because release tests read from the
same bucket as presubmit tests, and we want release tests to be secure."
