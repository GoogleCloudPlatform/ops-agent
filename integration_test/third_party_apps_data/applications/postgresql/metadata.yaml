description: |-
  The PostgreSQL integration collects database-usage metrics, such as the database
  size, the number of backends, or the number of operations. The integration also
  collects PostgreSQL logs and parses them into a JSON payload. This result
  includes fields for role, user, level, and message.
configure_integration: |-
  The `postgresql` receiver connects by default to a local `postgresql`
  server using a Unix socket and Unix authentication as the `root` user.

      description: The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration, for example 30s or 2m. This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
