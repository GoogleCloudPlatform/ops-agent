  The RabbitMQ integration collects message metrics, such as the number of
  delivered, published, and dropped messages. The integration also collects
  RabbitMQ logs and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes process
  ID, level, and message.

  For more information about RabbitMQ, see
  [rabbitmq.com/](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
