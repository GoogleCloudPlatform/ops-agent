  The RabbitMQ integration collects message metrics, such as the number of
  delivered, published, and dropped messages. The integration also collects
  RabbitMQ logs and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes process
  ID, level, and message.

        - name: include_paths
          default: '[var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit*.log]'
          description: A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card (*) can be used in the paths; for example, /var/log/rabbitmq/*.log.

          description: If set to `true`, then the path to the specific file from which the log record was obtained appears in the output log entry as the value of the `agent.googleapis.com/log_file_path` label. When using a wildcard, only the path of the file from which the record was obtained is recorded.
        - name: wildcard_refresh_interval
          default: 60s
          description: The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration, for example 30s or 2m. This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
