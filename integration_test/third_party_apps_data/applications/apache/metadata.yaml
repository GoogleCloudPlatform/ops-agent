  The Apache Web Server integration collects traffic-related metrics, such as the
  number of open connections or incoming requests. The integration also collects
  access and error logs. Access logs are parsed into a JSON payload focused on
  request details, and error logs are parsed for their error code and message.
configure_integration: |-
  To collect telemetry from your Apache Web Server, you must configure the
  server's `httpd.conf` file to enable the
  [`mod_status` plugin](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html)
  {: .external}.

  Many Apache installations enable this plugin by default. To see if the
  plugin is enabled on your VM instance, run:

  ```bash
  curl localhost:80/server-status?auto
  ```

  If the plugin is enabled, then the output includes lines similar to the
  following:

  <pre>
  Total Accesses: 2
  Total kBytes: 1
  BusyWorkers: 1
  IdleWorkers: 4
  </pre>

  If you get a `404 Not Found` page instead, then the `mod_status` plugin is not
  enabled.
