  The Apache CouchDB integration collects traffic-related metrics, such as the
  number of requests to a node and responses from the node. It also collects
  database metrics, such as how many are open and the number of operations. The
  integration collects general CouchDB and access logs and parses them into a JSON
  payload. The result includes fields for user, host, level, and message.

    fields:
    - name: type
      default: null
      description: The value must be couchdb.
    - name: include_paths
      default: '[/var/log/couchdb/couchdb.log]'
      description: A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card (*) can be used in the paths; for example, /var/log/couchdb*/*.log.

      description: If set to `true`, then the path to the specific file from which the log record was obtained appears in the output log entry as the value of the `agent.googleapis.com/log_file_path` label. When using a wildcard, only the path of the file from which the record was obtained is recorded.

      default: 60s
      description: The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration, for example 30s or 2m. This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
