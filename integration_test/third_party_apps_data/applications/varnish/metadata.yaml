  The Varnish integration collects cache and session metrics.
  It monitors the number of objects entering and exiting the cache,
  as well as the number of sessions and backend connections.
  The integration also collects Varnish logs and parses them
  into a standardized json payload.

  The Varnish logging processor processes logs using [varnishncsa](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/6.0/reference/varnishncsa.html){: .external}. Varnish can enable varnishncsa logging by following [this](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/){: .external} guide depending on os. By default, logs write to /var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log. If another file is chosen, the user will have to also update the receiver configuration. Logs are expected to be in the default format and a logrotation should be setup.
