  The Apache Tomcat integration collects traffic-related metrics, such as the
  number of active sessions or network throughput. The integration also collects
  access and Catalina logs. Access logs are parsed into a JSON payload
  focused on request details, whereas Catalina logs are parsed for general
  details. The `tomcat` receiver collects telemetry from the Tomcat server's Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM) via [JMX](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html).
configure_integration: |-
  To expose a JMX endpoint, you must set the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port`
  system property when starting the JVM. We also recommend setting the
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port` system property to the same port. To
  expose a JMX endpoint remotely, you must also set the `java.rmi.server.hostname`
  system property.

  By default, these properties are set in a Tomcat deployment's
  `tomcat-env.sh` file.

  To set system properties by using command-line arguments, prepend the property
  name with `-D` when starting the JVM. For example, to set
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` to port `8050`, specify the following when
  starting the JVM:

  <pre>
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8050
  </pre>
