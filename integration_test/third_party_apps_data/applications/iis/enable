# This config gets merged with the built-in Ops Agent config, which already
# includes the v1 receiver in the default pipeline.
# Because the v2 receiver here uses a unique ID, it does not overwrite
# the default receiver and so both receivers will be active simultaneously
# during the test.

# Create a back up of the existing file so existing configurations are not lost.
