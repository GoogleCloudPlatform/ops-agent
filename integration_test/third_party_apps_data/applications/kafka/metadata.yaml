  The Apache Kafka integration collects broker metrics, such as topic requests and
  failures. It also monitors the partitions on the broker. The integration
  collects Kafka logs and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes
  fields for logger, level, and message.

  To expose a JMX endpoint, you must set the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port`
  system property when starting the JVM. We also recommend setting the
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port` system property to the same port. To
  expose a JMX endpoint remotely, you must also set the `java.rmi.server.hostname`
  system property.

  By default, these properties are set in a Kafka deployment's
  `bin/kafka-run-class.sh` file.

  To set system properties by using command-line arguments, prepend the property
  name with `-D` when starting the JVM. For example, to set
  `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` to port `9999`, specify the following when
  starting the JVM:

  <pre>
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999
  </pre>

      description: The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration, for example 30s or 2m. This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
