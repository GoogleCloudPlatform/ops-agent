  The Apache ZooKeeper integration collects traffic metrics for nodes, such as
  latency, active requests, and active connections. The integration also collects
  ZooKeeper logs and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes fields
  for node ID, source, level, and message.

      description: The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration, for example 30s or 2m. This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
