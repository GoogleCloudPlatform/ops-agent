  The Apache ZooKeeper integration collects traffic metrics for nodes, such as
  latency, active requests, and active connections. The integration also collects
  ZooKeeper logs and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes fields
  for node ID, source, level, and message.

  For more information about ZooKeeper, see
  [zookeeper.apache.org](https://zookeeper.apache.org/).
