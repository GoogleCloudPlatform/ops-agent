  The Memcached integration primarily collects cache-usage metrics, such as the
  number of items in a cache, the number of evictions, and the number of bytes
  stored. It also collects general performance metrics for CPU usage and network
  throughput.

  For more information on Memcached, see
  [memcached.org](http://www.memcached.org/).
