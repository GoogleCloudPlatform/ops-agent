# Ops Agents

This repository contains the Ops Agents (Linux and Windows) that are part of the
Google Cloud Operations product suite (specifically Cloud Logging and Cloud
Monitoring).

The agents gather logs and metrics from your Google Compute Engine instances and
send them to Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring.
